      "True Answer: What are the signs and symptoms of Glycogen storage disease type 13? Glycogen storage disease type 13 causes muscle pain (myalgia).  Individuals with GSD13 also experience exercise intolerance, which means they have difficulty exercising because they may have muscle weakness and tire easily. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Glycogen storage disease type 13.

      "Predicted Answer: Hyperlipidemia type 3, also known as dysbetalipoproteinemia, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by elevated levels of triglycerides and cholesterol in the blood.  Unlike other forms of hyperlipidemia, type 3 is specifically associated with abnormally high levels of cholesterol-rich lipoprotein particles called chylomicron remnants and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL).  Importantly, **hyperlipidemia type 3 itself doesn't typically present with noticeable symptoms.**  The problem lies in the significantly increased risk of premature atherosclerosis and its associated complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the symptoms one might experience are actually the symptoms of the *complications* of untreated hyperlipidemia type 3, which include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Cardiovascular disease:** This is the most serious consequence.  Elevated cholesterol and triglycerides contribute to plaque buildup in arteries (atherosclerosis), leading to:\n",
      "    * **Coronary artery disease (CAD):** Chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, heart attack.\n",
      "    * **Stroke:** Weakness or numbness on one side of the body, difficulty speaking, vision problems.\n",
      "    * **Peripheral artery disease (PAD):** Leg pain, numbness, cramping, especially during exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Xanthelasma:** These are yellowish, cholesterol-rich deposits that can appear under the skin around the eyelids.  While not directly threatening, they're a visible sign of significantly elevated cholesterol.\n",

      "\n",
      "It is crucial to understand that the absence of noticeable symptoms doesn't mean the condition is harmless.  Regular blood lipid testing is vital for early detection and management, even in the absence of symptoms.  Treatment focuses on lifestyle modifications (diet and exercise) and medication to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels, thereby mitigating the risk of serious cardiovascular events.\n",

      "True Answer: What are the signs and symptoms of Oculodentodigital dysplasia? Individuals with oculodentodigital dysplasia commonly have small eyes (microphthalmia) and other eye abnormalities that can lead to vision loss. They also frequently have tooth abnormalities, such as small or missing teeth, weak enamel, multiple cavities, and early tooth loss. Other common features of this condition include a thin nose and webbing of the skin (syndactyly) between the fourth and fifth fingers. Less common features of oculodentodigital dysplasia include sparse hair growth (hypotrichosis), brittle nails, an unusual curvature of the fingers (camptodactyly), syndactyly of the toes, small head size (microcephaly), and an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). Some affected individuals experience neurological problems such as a lack of bladder or bowel control, difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), abnormal muscle stiffness (spasticity), hearing loss, and impaired speech (dysarthria). A few people with oculodentodigital dysplasia also have a skin condition called palmoplantar keratoderma. Palmoplantar keratoderma causes the skin on the palms and the soles of the feet to become thick, scaly, and calloused.

      "True Answer (including context): repressor Heme mediates derepression of Maf recognition element through direct binding to transcription repressor Bach1. Heme controls expression of genes involved in the synthesis of globins and heme. The mammalian transcription factor Bach1 functions as a repressor of the Maf recognition element (MARE) by forming antagonizing hetero-oligomers with the small Maf family proteins. We show here that heme binds specifically to Bach1 and regulates its DNA-binding activity. Deletion studies demonstrated that a heme-binding region of Bach1 is confined within its C-terminal region that possesses four dipeptide cysteine-proline (CP) motifs. Mutations in all of the CP motifs of Bach1 abolished its interaction with heme. The DNA-binding activity of Bach1 as a MafK hetero-oligomer was markedly inhibited by heme in gel mobility shift assays. The repressor activity of Bach1 was lost upon addition of hemin in transfected cells. These results suggest that increased levels of heme inactivate the repressor Bach1, resulting in induction of a host of genes with MARES:\n",

      "Q: Which hormone concentrations are altered in patients with the Allan–Herndon–Dudley syndrome?\n",
      "True Answer (including context): thyroid Lack of action of exogenously administered T3 on the fetal rat brain despite expression of the monocarboxylate transporter 8. Mutations of the monocarboxylate transporter 8 gene (MCT8, SLC16A2) cause the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, an X-linked syndrome of severe intellectual deficit and neurological impairment. Mct8 transports thyroid hormones (T4 and T3), and the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome is likely caused by lack of T3 transport to neurons during critical periods of fetal brain development. To evaluate the role of Mct8 in thyroid hormone action in the fetal brain we administered T4 or T3 to thyroidectomized pregnant dams treated with methyl-mercapto-imidazol to produce maternal and fetal hypothyroidism. Gene expression was then measured in the fetal cerebral cortex. T4 increased Camk4, Sema3c, and Slc7a3 expression, but T3 was without effect. To investigate the cause for the lack of T3 action we analyzed the expression of organic anion transport polypeptide (Oatp14, Slco1c1), a T4 transporter, and Mct8 (Slc16a2), a T4 and T3 transporter, by confocal microscopy. Both proteins were present in the brain capillaries forming the blood-brain barrier and in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus forming the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. It is concluded that T4 from the maternal compartment influences gene expression in the fetal cerebral cortex, possibly after transport via organic anion transporter polypeptide and/or Mct8, and conversion to T3 in the astrocytes. On the other hand, T3 does not reach the target neurons despite the presence of Mct8. The data indicate that T4, through local deiodination, provides most T3 in the fetal rat brain. The role of Mct8 as a T3 transporter in the fetal rat brain is therefore uncertain.\n",

      "True Answer (including context): experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) Microwave and magnetic (M(2) ) proteomics of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis animal model of multiple sclerosis. We hypothesized that quantitative MS/MS-based proteomics at multiple time points, incorporating rapid microwave and magnetic (M(2) ) sample preparation, could enable relative protein expression to be correlated to disease progression in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model of multiple sclerosis. To test our hypothesis, microwave-assisted reduction/alkylation/digestion of proteins from brain tissue lysates bound to C8 magnetic beads and microwave-assisted isobaric chemical labeling were performed of released peptides, in 90 s prior to unbiased proteomic analysis. Disease progression in EAE was assessed by scoring clinical EAE disease severity and confirmed by histopathologic evaluation for central nervous system inflammation. Decoding the expression of 283 top-ranked proteins (p <0.05) at each time point relative to their expression at the peak of disease, from a total of 1191 proteins observed in four technical replicates, revealed a strong statistical correlation to EAE disease score, particularly for the following four proteins that closely mirror disease progression: 14-3-3ε (p = 3.4E-6); GPI (p = 2.1E-5); PLP1 (p = 8.0E-4); PRX1 (p = 1.7E-4). These results were confirmed by Western blotting, signaling pathway analysis, and hierarchical clustering of EAE risk groups. While validation in a larger cohort is underway, we conclude that M(2) proteomics is a rapid method to quantify putative prognostic/predictive protein biomarkers and therapeutic targets of disease progression in the EAE animal model of multiple sclerosis.\n",

Inhibition of NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) has emerged as a highly promising approach to treat cancer through the adenosine sulfamate analog MLN4924. Here, we show that selective pressure results in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells with decreased MLN4924 sensitivity and identify a single-nucleotide transition that changes alanine 171 to threonine (A171T) of the NAE subunit UBA3. This reduces the enzyme's affinity for MLN4924 and ATP while increasing NEDD8 activation at physiological ATP concentrations. Expression of UBA3 A171T is sufficient to decrease MLN4924 sensitivity of naive HCT116 cells, indicating that it is a dominant suppressor of MLN4924-mediated cell death. Our data suggest that the on-target potency of MLN4924 selects for a point mutation in NAE that overcomes the molecule's inhibitory effects, allowing cancer cell survival.\n",

      "Q: Which fusion protein is involved in the development of Ewing sarcoma?\n",
      "True Answer (including context): EWS/FLI1 Ewing sarcoma EWS protein regulates midzone formation by recruiting Aurora B kinase to the midzone. Ewing sarcoma is a malignant bone cancer that primarily occurs in children and adolescents. Eighty-five percent of Ewing sarcoma is characterized by the presence of the aberrant chimeric EWS/FLI1 fusion gene. Previously, we demonstrated that an interaction between EWS/FLI1 and wild-type EWS led to the inhibition of EWS activity and mitotic dysfunction. Although defective mitosis is considered to be a critical step in cancer initiation, it is unknown how interference with EWS contributes to Ewing sarcoma formation. Here, we demonstrate that EWS/FLI1- and EWS-knockdown cells display a high incidence of defects in the midzone, a midline structure located between segregating chromatids during anaphase. Defects in the midzone can lead to the failure of cytokinesis and can result in the induction of aneuploidy. The similarity among the phenotypes of EWS/FLI1- and EWS siRNA-transfected HeLa cells points to the inhibition of EWS as the key mechanism for the induction of midzone defects. Supporting this observation, the ectopic expression of EWS rescues the high incidence of midzone defects observed in Ewing sarcoma A673 cells. We discovered that EWS interacts with Aurora B kinase, and that EWS is also required for recruiting Aurora B to the midzone. A domain analysis revealed that the R565 in the RGG3 domain of EWS is essential for both Aurora B interaction and the recruitment of Aurora B to the midzone. Here, we propose that the impairment of EWS-dependent midzone formation via the recruitment of Aurora B is a potential mechanism of Ewing sarcoma development.\n",

      "Q: Which MAP kinase phosphorylates the transcription factor c-jun?\n",
      "True Answer (including context): JNK High yield purification of JNK1β1 and activation by in vitro reconstitution of the MEKK1→MKK4→JNK MAPK phosphorylation cascade. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway forms part of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways comprising a sequential three-tiered kinase cascade. Here, an upstream MAP3K (MEKK1) phosphorylates and activates a MAP2K (MKK4 and MKK7), which in turn phosphorylates and activates the MAPK, JNK. The C-terminal kinase domain of MEKK1 (MEKK-C) is constitutively active, while MKK4/7 and JNK are both activated by dual phosphorylation of S/Y, and T/Y residues within their activation loops, respectively. While improvements in the purification of large quantities of active JNKs have recently been made, inadequacies in their yield, purity, and the efficiency of their phosphorylation still exist. We describe a novel and robust method that further improves upon the purification of large yields of highly pure, phosphorylated JNK1β1, which is most suitable for biochemical and biophysical characterization. Codon harmonization of the JNK1β1 gene was used as a precautionary measure toward increasing the soluble overexpression of the kinase. While JNK1β1 and its substrate ATF2 were both purified to >99% purity as GST fusion proteins using GSH-agarose affinity chromatography and each cleaved from GST using thrombin, constitutively-active MEKK-C and inactive MKK4 were separately expressed in E. coli as thioredoxin-His(6)-tagged proteins and purified using urea refolding and Ni(2+)-IMAC, respectively. Activation of JNK1β1 was then achieved by successfully reconstituting the JNK MAPK activation cascade in vitro; MEKK-C was used to activate MKK4, which in turn was used to efficiently phosphorylate and activate large quantities of JNK1β1. Activated JNK1β1 was thereafter able to phosphorylate ATF2 with high catalytic efficiency.\n",

We have compared the chromosomal mobilization efficiency and insertion site preference of the two transposons mobilized from the same donor site in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells under conditions in which there were no selective constraints on the transposons' insertion sites. Compared with Sleeping Beauty, PiggyBac exhibits higher transposition efficiencies, no evidence for local hopping and a significant bias toward reintegration in intragenic regions, which demonstrate its utility for insertional mutagenesis. Although Sleeping Beauty had no detectable genomic bias with respect to insertions in genes or intergenic regions, both Sleeping Beauty and PiggyBac transposons displayed preferential integration into actively transcribed loci.\n",

      "Q: Which MAP kinase phosphorylates the transcription factor c-jun?\n",
      "True Answer (including context): c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase Transcriptional regulation by MAP kinases. Tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors activate MAP kinase by a complex mechanism involving the SH2/3 protein Grb2, the exchange protein Sos, and Ras. The GTP-bound Ras protein binds to the Raf kinase and initiates a protein kinase cascade that leads to MAP kinase activation. Three MAP kinase kinase kinases have been described--c-Raf, c-Mos, and Mekk--that phosphorylate and activate Mek, the MAP kinase kinase. Activated Mek phosphorylates and activates MAP kinase. Subsequently, the activated MAP kinase translocates into the nucleus where many of the physiological targets of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway are located. These substrates include transcription factors that are regulated by MAP kinase phosphorylation (e.g., Elk-1, c-Myc, c-Jun, c-Fos, and C/EBP beta). Thus the MAP kinase pathway represents a significant mechanism of signal transduction by growth factor receptors from the cell surface to the nucleus that results in the regulation of gene expression. Three MAP kinase homologs have been identified in the rat: Erk1, Erk2, and Erk3. Human MAP kinases that are similar to the rat Erk kinases have also been identified by molecular cloning. The human Erk1 protein kinase has been shown to be widely expressed as a 44-kDa protein in many tissues. The human Erk2 protein kinase is a 41-kDa protein that is expressed ubiquitously. In contrast, a human Erk3-related protein kinase has been found to be expressed at a high level only in heart muscle and brain. The loci of these MAP kinase genes are widely distributed within the human genome: erk2 at 22q11.2; erk1 at 16p11.2; and ek3-related at 18q12-21. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, five MAP kinase gene homologs have been described: smkl, mpk1, hog1, fus3, and kss1. Together, these kinases are a more diverse group than the human erks that have been identified. Thus the erks are likely to represent only one subgroup of a larger human MAP kinase gene family. A candidate for this extended family of MAP kinases is the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (Jnk), which binds to and phosphorylates the transcription factor c-Jun at the activating sites Ser-63 and Ser-73. Evidence is presented here to demonstrate that Jnk is a distant relative of the MAP kinase group that is activated by dual phosphorylation at Tyr and Thr.\n",

      "Q: What is the usual HER-2 status in breast cancer associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome?\n",
      "True Answer (including context): positive Early onset HER2-positive breast cancer is associated with germline TP53 mutations. BACKGROUND: Germline TP53 mutations predispose to early onset breast cancer in women and are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Published data on the pathological characteristics of breast cancer among women with TP53 mutations is limited. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of women who underwent genetic testing for suspected germline TP53 mutations and who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 2000 and 2011. The pathological characteristics of the breast tumors from patients testing positive for a mutation (cases) were compared with those testing negative (controls). RESULTS: Patients who tested positive for germlineTP53 mutations (n = 30) were compared with controls (n = 79). Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification and/or overexpression was found in 67% of the tumors from the cases, compared with 25% for the controls (P = .0001). Among patients with a mutation, 70% had estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive tumors, compared with 68% in the control group (P = .87). After adjusting for age at breast cancer diagnosis, having a HER2-positive tumor increased the odds of testing positive for a germline TP53 mutation (odds ratio, 6.9; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-18.2). For each yearly increment in age at breast cancer diagnosis, there was decreased likelihood of having a TP53 mutation of 5% (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval0.91-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests an association between germline TP53 mutations and early onset HER2-positive breast cancer. If confirmed in a larger cohort, these results could guide genetic testing strategies, lead to chemoprevention trials incorporating HER2-targeted therapies, and elucidate some of the molecular pathways involved in breast cancer.\n",

      "True Answer (including context): Calcineurin Calcineurin signaling and NFAT activation in cardiovascular and skeletal muscle development. Calcineurin signaling has been implicated in a broad spectrum of developmental processes in a variety of organ systems. Calcineurin is a calmodulin-dependent, calcium-activated protein phosphatase composed of catalytic and regulatory subunits. The serine/threonine-specific phosphatase functions within a signal transduction pathway that regulates gene expression and biological responses in many developmentally important cell types. Calcineurin signaling was first defined in T lymphocytes as a regulator of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factor nuclear translocation and activation. Recent studies have demonstrated the vital nature of calcium/calcineurin/NFAT signaling in cardiovascular and skeletal muscle development in vertebrates. Inhibition, mutation, or forced expression of calcineurin pathway genes result in defects or alterations in cardiomyocyte maturation, heart valve formation, vascular development, skeletal muscle differentiation and fiber-type switching, and cardiac and skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Conserved calcineurin genes are found in invertebrates such as Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, and genetic studies have demonstrated specific myogenic functions for the phosphatase in their development. The ability to investigate calcineurin signaling pathways in vertebrates and model genetic organisms provides a great potential to more fully comprehend the functions of calcineurin and its interacting genes in heart, blood vessel, and muscle development.\n",

      "Q: Is the transcriptional regulator BACH1 an activator or a repressor?\n",
      "True Answer (including context): repressor Heme mediates derepression of Maf recognition element through direct binding to transcription repressor Bach1. Heme controls expression of genes involved in the synthesis of globins and heme. The mammalian transcription factor Bach1 functions as a repressor of the Maf recognition element (MARE) by forming antagonizing hetero-oligomers with the small Maf family proteins. We show here that heme binds specifically to Bach1 and regulates its DNA-binding activity. Deletion studies demonstrated that a heme-binding region of Bach1 is confined within its C-terminal region that possesses four dipeptide cysteine-proline (CP) motifs. Mutations in all of the CP motifs of Bach1 abolished its interaction with heme. The DNA-binding activity of Bach1 as a MafK hetero-oligomer was markedly inhibited by heme in gel mobility shift assays. The repressor activity of Bach1 was lost upon addition of hemin in transfected cells. These results suggest that increased levels of heme inactivate the repressor Bach1, resulting in induction of a host of genes with MARES:\n",

      "Q: Which hormone concentrations are altered in patients with the Allan–Herndon–Dudley syndrome?\n",
      "True Answer (including context): thyroid Lack of action of exogenously administered T3 on the fetal rat brain despite expression of the monocarboxylate transporter 8. Mutations of the monocarboxylate transporter 8 gene (MCT8, SLC16A2) cause the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, an X-linked syndrome of severe intellectual deficit and neurological impairment. Mct8 transports thyroid hormones (T4 and T3), and the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome is likely caused by lack of T3 transport to neurons during critical periods of fetal brain development. To evaluate the role of Mct8 in thyroid hormone action in the fetal brain we administered T4 or T3 to thyroidectomized pregnant dams treated with methyl-mercapto-imidazol to produce maternal and fetal hypothyroidism. Gene expression was then measured in the fetal cerebral cortex. T4 increased Camk4, Sema3c, and Slc7a3 expression, but T3 was without effect. To investigate the cause for the lack of T3 action we analyzed the expression of organic anion transport polypeptide (Oatp14, Slco1c1), a T4 transporter, and Mct8 (Slc16a2), a T4 and T3 transporter, by confocal microscopy. Both proteins were present in the brain capillaries forming the blood-brain barrier and in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus forming the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. It is concluded that T4 from the maternal compartment influences gene expression in the fetal cerebral cortex, possibly after transport via organic anion transporter polypeptide and/or Mct8, and conversion to T3 in the astrocytes. On the other hand, T3 does not reach the target neurons despite the presence of Mct8. The data indicate that T4, through local deiodination, provides most T3 in the fetal rat brain. The role of Mct8 as a T3 transporter in the fetal rat brain is therefore uncertain.\n",

      "True Answer (including context): experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) Microwave and magnetic (M(2) ) proteomics of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis animal model of multiple sclerosis. We hypothesized that quantitative MS/MS-based proteomics at multiple time points, incorporating rapid microwave and magnetic (M(2) ) sample preparation, could enable relative protein expression to be correlated to disease progression in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model of multiple sclerosis. To test our hypothesis, microwave-assisted reduction/alkylation/digestion of proteins from brain tissue lysates bound to C8 magnetic beads and microwave-assisted isobaric chemical labeling were performed of released peptides, in 90 s prior to unbiased proteomic analysis. Disease progression in EAE was assessed by scoring clinical EAE disease severity and confirmed by histopathologic evaluation for central nervous system inflammation. Decoding the expression of 283 top-ranked proteins (p <0.05) at each time point relative to their expression at the peak of disease, from a total of 1191 proteins observed in four technical replicates, revealed a strong statistical correlation to EAE disease score, particularly for the following four proteins that closely mirror disease progression: 14-3-3ε (p = 3.4E-6); GPI (p = 2.1E-5); PLP1 (p = 8.0E-4); PRX1 (p = 1.7E-4). These results were confirmed by Western blotting, signaling pathway analysis, and hierarchical clustering of EAE risk groups. While validation in a larger cohort is underway, we conclude that M(2) proteomics is a rapid method to quantify putative prognostic/predictive protein biomarkers and therapeutic targets of disease progression in the EAE animal model of multiple sclerosis.\n",

      "True Answer (including context): NEDD8-activating enzyme A gatekeeper residue for NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibition by MLN4924. Inhibition of NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) has emerged as a highly promising approach to treat cancer through the adenosine sulfamate analog MLN4924. Here, we show that selective pressure results in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells with decreased MLN4924 sensitivity and identify a single-nucleotide transition that changes alanine 171 to threonine (A171T) of the NAE subunit UBA3. This reduces the enzyme's affinity for MLN4924 and ATP while increasing NEDD8 activation at physiological ATP concentrations. Expression of UBA3 A171T is sufficient to decrease MLN4924 sensitivity of naive HCT116 cells, indicating that it is a dominant suppressor of MLN4924-mediated cell death. Our data suggest that the on-target potency of MLN4924 selects for a point mutation in NAE that overcomes the molecule's inhibitory effects, allowing cancer cell survival.\n",

      "Q: Which fusion protein is involved in the development of Ewing sarcoma?\n",
      "True Answer (including context): EWS/FLI1 Ewing sarcoma EWS protein regulates midzone formation by recruiting Aurora B kinase to the midzone. Ewing sarcoma is a malignant bone cancer that primarily occurs in children and adolescents. Eighty-five percent of Ewing sarcoma is characterized by the presence of the aberrant chimeric EWS/FLI1 fusion gene. Previously, we demonstrated that an interaction between EWS/FLI1 and wild-type EWS led to the inhibition of EWS activity and mitotic dysfunction. Although defective mitosis is considered to be a critical step in cancer initiation, it is unknown how interference with EWS contributes to Ewing sarcoma formation. Here, we demonstrate that EWS/FLI1- and EWS-knockdown cells display a high incidence of defects in the midzone, a midline structure located between segregating chromatids during anaphase. Defects in the midzone can lead to the failure of cytokinesis and can result in the induction of aneuploidy. The similarity among the phenotypes of EWS/FLI1- and EWS siRNA-transfected HeLa cells points to the inhibition of EWS as the key mechanism for the induction of midzone defects. Supporting this observation, the ectopic expression of EWS rescues the high incidence of midzone defects observed in Ewing sarcoma A673 cells. We discovered that EWS interacts with Aurora B kinase, and that EWS is also required for recruiting Aurora B to the midzone. A domain analysis revealed that the R565 in the RGG3 domain of EWS is essential for both Aurora B interaction and the recruitment of Aurora B to the midzone. Here, we propose that the impairment of EWS-dependent midzone formation via the recruitment of Aurora B is a potential mechanism of Ewing sarcoma development.\n",

      "True Answer (including context): JNK High yield purification of JNK1β1 and activation by in vitro reconstitution of the MEKK1→MKK4→JNK MAPK phosphorylation cascade. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway forms part of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways comprising a sequential three-tiered kinase cascade. Here, an upstream MAP3K (MEKK1) phosphorylates and activates a MAP2K (MKK4 and MKK7), which in turn phosphorylates and activates the MAPK, JNK. The C-terminal kinase domain of MEKK1 (MEKK-C) is constitutively active, while MKK4/7 and JNK are both activated by dual phosphorylation of S/Y, and T/Y residues within their activation loops, respectively. While improvements in the purification of large quantities of active JNKs have recently been made, inadequacies in their yield, purity, and the efficiency of their phosphorylation still exist. We describe a novel and robust method that further improves upon the purification of large yields of highly pure, phosphorylated JNK1β1, which is most suitable for biochemical and biophysical characterization. Codon harmonization of the JNK1β1 gene was used as a precautionary measure toward increasing the soluble overexpression of the kinase. While JNK1β1 and its substrate ATF2 were both purified to >99% purity as GST fusion proteins using GSH-agarose affinity chromatography and each cleaved from GST using thrombin, constitutively-active MEKK-C and inactive MKK4 were separately expressed in E. coli as thioredoxin-His(6)-tagged proteins and purified using urea refolding and Ni(2+)-IMAC, respectively. Activation of JNK1β1 was then achieved by successfully reconstituting the JNK MAPK activation cascade in vitro; MEKK-C was used to activate MKK4, which in turn was used to efficiently phosphorylate and activate large quantities of JNK1β1. Activated JNK1β1 was thereafter able to phosphorylate ATF2 with high catalytic efficiency.\n",

Therefore, I will answer based on my general medical knowledge.\\n\\nBoth Sleeping Beauty and piggyBac are widely used transposon systems in gene therapy and research, but their transposition efficiencies differ significantly and depend heavily on various factors including:\\n\\n* **Target cell type:**  Efficiency varies greatly depending on the cell's specific characteristics.  Some cell types are more permissive to transposition than others.\\n\\n* **Transposon design:**  Modifications to the transposon itself (e.g., changes to the terminal inverted repeats, promoter strength, cargo size) significantly influence efficiency.\\n\\n* **Delivery method:** The method used to introduce the transposon into the target cells (viral vectors, non-viral methods) affects its efficiency.\\n\\n* **Assay method:** The method used to measure transposition efficiency can also impact the results.\\n\\n**Generally speaking,  piggyBac transposons are often considered to have higher transposition efficiency than Sleeping Beauty transposons.**  However, this is not a universally true statement.  Many studies show piggyBac achieving higher rates of genomic integration. This is partly attributed to its ability to mobilize larger DNA fragments and its preference for less repetitive regions of the genome.\\n\\n\\nIt's crucial to note that direct comparison of transposition efficiencies from different studies can be difficult due to the varying experimental conditions mentioned above.  The optimal choice between Sleeping Beauty and piggyBac, or other transposon systems, depends on the specific application and needs of the experiment or gene therapy protocol.  A detailed literature review focusing on specific cell types and experimental setups would be required to make a definitive statement about relative efficiencies in a particular context.\\n\"\n",

      "Q: Which MAP kinase phosphorylates the transcription factor c-jun?\n",
      "True Answer (including context): c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase Transcriptional regulation by MAP kinases. Tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors activate MAP kinase by a complex mechanism involving the SH2/3 protein Grb2, the exchange protein Sos, and Ras. The GTP-bound Ras protein binds to the Raf kinase and initiates a protein kinase cascade that leads to MAP kinase activation. Three MAP kinase kinase kinases have been described--c-Raf, c-Mos, and Mekk--that phosphorylate and activate Mek, the MAP kinase kinase. Activated Mek phosphorylates and activates MAP kinase. Subsequently, the activated MAP kinase translocates into the nucleus where many of the physiological targets of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway are located. These substrates include transcription factors that are regulated by MAP kinase phosphorylation (e.g., Elk-1, c-Myc, c-Jun, c-Fos, and C/EBP beta). Thus the MAP kinase pathway represents a significant mechanism of signal transduction by growth factor receptors from the cell surface to the nucleus that results in the regulation of gene expression. Three MAP kinase homologs have been identified in the rat: Erk1, Erk2, and Erk3. Human MAP kinases that are similar to the rat Erk kinases have also been identified by molecular cloning. The human Erk1 protein kinase has been shown to be widely expressed as a 44-kDa protein in many tissues. The human Erk2 protein kinase is a 41-kDa protein that is expressed ubiquitously. In contrast, a human Erk3-related protein kinase has been found to be expressed at a high level only in heart muscle and brain. The loci of these MAP kinase genes are widely distributed within the human genome: erk2 at 22q11.2; erk1 at 16p11.2; and ek3-related at 18q12-21. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, five MAP kinase gene homologs have been described: smkl, mpk1, hog1, fus3, and kss1. Together, these kinases are a more diverse group than the human erks that have been identified. Thus the erks are likely to represent only one subgroup of a larger human MAP kinase gene family. A candidate for this extended family of MAP kinases is the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (Jnk), which binds to and phosphorylates the transcription factor c-Jun at the activating sites Ser-63 and Ser-73. Evidence is presented here to demonstrate that Jnk is a distant relative of the MAP kinase group that is activated by dual phosphorylation at Tyr and Thr.\n",

      "Q: What is the usual HER-2 status in breast cancer associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome?\n",
      "True Answer (including context): positive Early onset HER2-positive breast cancer is associated with germline TP53 mutations. BACKGROUND: Germline TP53 mutations predispose to early onset breast cancer in women and are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Published data on the pathological characteristics of breast cancer among women with TP53 mutations is limited. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of women who underwent genetic testing for suspected germline TP53 mutations and who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 2000 and 2011. The pathological characteristics of the breast tumors from patients testing positive for a mutation (cases) were compared with those testing negative (controls). RESULTS: Patients who tested positive for germlineTP53 mutations (n = 30) were compared with controls (n = 79). Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification and/or overexpression was found in 67% of the tumors from the cases, compared with 25% for the controls (P = .0001). Among patients with a mutation, 70% had estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive tumors, compared with 68% in the control group (P = .87). After adjusting for age at breast cancer diagnosis, having a HER2-positive tumor increased the odds of testing positive for a germline TP53 mutation (odds ratio, 6.9; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-18.2). For each yearly increment in age at breast cancer diagnosis, there was decreased likelihood of having a TP53 mutation of 5% (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval0.91-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests an association between germline TP53 mutations and early onset HER2-positive breast cancer. If confirmed in a larger cohort, these results could guide genetic testing strategies, lead to chemoprevention trials incorporating HER2-targeted therapies, and elucidate some of the molecular pathways involved in breast cancer.\n",

Therefore, I must rely on general medical knowledge.\\n\\nLi-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare inherited disorder characterized by an increased risk of several types of cancer, including breast cancer.  While LFS significantly increases the overall risk of developing breast cancer, it doesn't inherently dictate the HER-2 status of the resulting cancer.  HER-2 status (whether the cancer cells overexpress the HER2 protein) is determined independently and is a characteristic of the individual tumor, not a consequence of the underlying genetic predisposition.  Therefore, breast cancers in individuals with LFS can be HER2-positive, HER2-negative, or HER2-equivocal, just like breast cancers in the general population.  The HER-2 status needs to be determined through testing (immunohistochemistry and/or FISH) on the specific tumor tissue.\\n\"\n",

      "True Answer (including context): Calcineurin Calcineurin signaling and NFAT activation in cardiovascular and skeletal muscle development. Calcineurin signaling has been implicated in a broad spectrum of developmental processes in a variety of organ systems. Calcineurin is a calmodulin-dependent, calcium-activated protein phosphatase composed of catalytic and regulatory subunits. The serine/threonine-specific phosphatase functions within a signal transduction pathway that regulates gene expression and biological responses in many developmentally important cell types. Calcineurin signaling was first defined in T lymphocytes as a regulator of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factor nuclear translocation and activation. Recent studies have demonstrated the vital nature of calcium/calcineurin/NFAT signaling in cardiovascular and skeletal muscle development in vertebrates. Inhibition, mutation, or forced expression of calcineurin pathway genes result in defects or alterations in cardiomyocyte maturation, heart valve formation, vascular development, skeletal muscle differentiation and fiber-type switching, and cardiac and skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Conserved calcineurin genes are found in invertebrates such as Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, and genetic studies have demonstrated specific myogenic functions for the phosphatase in their development. The ability to investigate calcineurin signaling pathways in vertebrates and model genetic organisms provides a great potential to more fully comprehend the functions of calcineurin and its interacting genes in heart, blood vessel, and muscle development.\n",

      "True Answer: What are the signs and symptoms of Glycogen storage disease type 13? Glycogen storage disease type 13 causes muscle pain (myalgia).  Individuals with GSD13 also experience exercise intolerance, which means they have difficulty exercising because they may have muscle weakness and tire easily. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Glycogen storage disease type 13. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Adult onset - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Elevated serum creatine phosphokinase - Exercise intolerance - Increased muscle glycogen content - Myalgia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available.

Therefore, I will answer based on my general medical knowledge.\\n\\nHyperlipidemia type 3 is a rare genetic disorder characterized by extremely high levels of triglycerides and cholesterol in the blood.  Unlike other types of hyperlipidemia, it's specifically associated with an accumulation of cholesterol-rich remnants (chylomicron and VLDL remnants) in the blood.  Because these remnants are not properly cleared, they can deposit in various tissues, leading to the potential development of health problems.\\n\\n**Symptoms of Hyperlipidemia Type 3 are often subtle and may not appear until adulthood.**  Many individuals are diagnosed incidentally through routine blood tests revealing elevated lipid levels.  However, some people may experience symptoms related to the accumulation of lipids, which can include:\\n\\n* **Xanthelasmas:** yellowish cholesterol deposits under the skin, typically around the eyelids.\\n* **Xanthomas:** yellowish cholesterol deposits in tendons (tendon xanthomas), palms ( palmar xanthomas), or other areas.  These are more extensive than xanthelasmas.\\n* **Tuberoeruptive xanthoma:** These are eruptive xanthomas that present as small, raised, yellowish papules.  They are associated with very high triglyceride levels.\\n* **Accelerated atherosclerosis:** This leads to an increased risk of premature cardiovascular disease, presenting with symptoms such as angina (chest pain), shortness of breath, and potentially heart attack or stroke.\\n* **Hepatosplenomegaly:** Enlargement of the liver and spleen due to lipid accumulation. This may be asymptomatic or present with vague abdominal discomfort.\\n* **Rarely:** Abdominal pain from pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) due to very high triglyceride levels.\\n\\nIt's crucial to understand that the presence of these symptoms doesn't definitively diagnose Hyperlipidemia type 3.  A diagnosis requires blood tests to measure lipid levels, specifically demonstrating elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and often genetic testing to confirm the specific genetic defect.  The absence of visible symptoms doesn't rule out the condition.  Regular lipid panel screenings, particularly for individuals with a family history of hyperlipidemia, are essential for early detection and management.\\n\"\n",

      "Q: What are the symptoms of Oculodentodigital dysplasia ?\n",
      "True Answer: What are the signs and symptoms of Oculodentodigital dysplasia? Individuals with oculodentodigital dysplasia commonly have small eyes (microphthalmia) and other eye abnormalities that can lead to vision loss. They also frequently have tooth abnormalities, such as small or missing teeth, weak enamel, multiple cavities, and early tooth loss. Other common features of this condition include a thin nose and webbing of the skin (syndactyly) between the fourth and fifth fingers. Less common features of oculodentodigital dysplasia include sparse hair growth (hypotrichosis), brittle nails, an unusual curvature of the fingers (camptodactyly), syndactyly of the toes, small head size (microcephaly), and an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). Some affected individuals experience neurological problems such as a lack of bladder or bowel control, difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), abnormal muscle stiffness (spasticity), hearing loss, and impaired speech (dysarthria). A few people with oculodentodigital dysplasia also have a skin condition called palmoplantar keratoderma. Palmoplantar keratoderma causes the skin on the palms and the soles of the feet to become thick, scaly, and calloused. Some features of oculodentodigital dysplasia are evident at birth, while others become apparent with age.

However, common features include:\\n\\n**Eye abnormalities:** These are often the most prominent features and may include:\\n\\n* **Small eyes (microphthalmia):**  The eyes may be abnormally small.\\n* **Eyelid abnormalities (ptosis):** Drooping eyelids.\\n* **Abnormal irises:**  Variations in the coloring or shape of the iris.\\n* **Other eye malformations:**  These can range from minor irregularities to more severe structural problems.\\n\\n**Dental abnormalities:**  Dental problems are also frequently observed and can include:\\n\\n* **Missing teeth (hypodontia):** Some teeth may be absent.\\n* **Small teeth (microdontia):** Teeth may be smaller than normal.\\n* **Conical teeth:** Teeth may have a cone-like shape.\\n* **Abnormal tooth enamel:** Enamel may be thin or poorly developed.\\n* **Malocclusion:** Problems with the alignment of the teeth.\\n\\n\\n**Hand and finger abnormalities:**  These are typically characterized by:\\n\\n* **Small hands and fingers (micromelia):**  Overall size reduction of the hands and fingers.\\n* **Shortened bones (brachydactyly):**  Individual bones in the hands and fingers may be abnormally short.\\n* **Bent fingers (clinodactyly):**  Fingers may be curved or bent.\\n* **Limited range of motion in joints:**  Stiffness and reduced flexibility in the hand and finger joints.\\n* **Syndactyly:**  Fusion of fingers or toes.\\n\\n**Other potential symptoms:** While less common, some individuals with ODD may also experience:\\n\\n* **Intellectual disability:**  Varying degrees of cognitive impairment.\\n* **Hearing loss:**  Sensorineural hearing impairment.\\n* **Facial abnormalities:**  Unusual facial features.\\n* **Other developmental delays:**  Depending on the severity of the condition.\\n\\nIt's crucial to remember that the severity and combination of these symptoms vary greatly in individuals with ODD. Some individuals may only exhibit mild symptoms affecting a single body system, while others experience more severe multi-system involvement.  A proper diagnosis requires a thorough clinical evaluation by a medical professional, often involving genetic testing to confirm the condition.\\n\"\n",

There is no overlap in their core symptoms.\\n\\n**Deafness (Hearing Loss):**  The primary symptom is the inability to hear sounds, ranging from mild difficulty distinguishing certain sounds to complete loss of hearing.  The severity and type of deafness (conductive, sensorineural, or mixed) will influence the specific symptoms.  Additional symptoms may include tinnitus (ringing in the ears), dizziness (vertigo), and difficulties with balance, depending on the underlying cause of the hearing loss.\\n\\n**Dystonia:**  This is a movement disorder characterized by sustained muscle contractions, causing twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. Symptoms vary greatly depending on the type and location of dystonia.  They can include:\\n\\n* **Focal dystonia:** Affecting a single body part (e.g., writer's cramp affecting the hand, blepharospasm affecting the eyelids).\\n* **Segmental dystonia:** Affecting two or more adjacent body parts (e.g., cervical dystonia affecting the neck and shoulders).\\n* **Multifocal dystonia:** Affecting two or more non-adjacent body parts.\\n* **Generalized dystonia:** Affecting multiple body parts and often beginning in childhood.\\n\\nSymptoms can also include pain, tremor, and difficulty with speech (dysarthria) or swallowing (dysphagia). The severity can range from mild to severely disabling.\\n\\n**Cerebral Hypomyelination:** This is a group of rare genetic disorders where there is insufficient myelin (the protective sheath around nerve fibers in the brain) leading to neurological problems.  Symptoms are variable and depend on the specific genetic defect and the extent of hypomyelination.  Common symptoms may include:\\n\\n* **Developmental delay:** Significant delays in reaching developmental milestones (e.g., sitting, crawling, walking, talking).\\n* **Intellectual disability:**  Varying degrees of cognitive impairment.\\n* **Seizures:**  Episodes of abnormal brain activity.\\n* **Spasticity:**  Increased muscle tone and stiffness.\\n* **Weakness:**  Muscle weakness and hypotonia (low muscle tone) may also be present.\\n* **Ataxia:**  Problems with coordination and balance.\\n* **Visual impairment:**  Problems with vision.\\n\\nThe severity of symptoms in cerebral hypomyelination can range from mild to severe, and the presentation can vary significantly between individuals.

      "Q: What are the symptoms of Trichomegaly with intellectual disability, dwarfism and pigmentary degeneration of retina ?\n",
      "True Answer: What are the signs and symptoms of Trichomegaly with intellectual disability, dwarfism and pigmentary degeneration of retina? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Trichomegaly with intellectual disability, dwarfism and pigmentary degeneration of retina. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of retinal pigmentation 90% Abnormality of the eyelashes 90% Abnormality of the genital system 90% Anterior hypopituitarism 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Decreased nerve conduction velocity 90% Delayed eruption of teeth 90% Delayed skeletal maturation 90% Heterochromia iridis 90% Intrauterine growth retardation 90% Nystagmus 90% Thick eyebrow 90% Truncal obesity 90% Visual impairment 90% Fine hair 50% Frontal bossing 50% Prominent occiput 50% Synophrys 50% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Central heterochromia - Cryptorchidism - Delayed puberty - Distal amyotrophy - Distal muscle weakness - Growth hormone deficiency - Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism - Hypoplasia of penis - Intellectual disability - Long eyebrows - Long eyelashes - Peripheral axonal neuropathy - Pigmentary retinal degeneration - Severe short stature - Small for gestational age - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.\n",

Therefore, I cannot answer your question using the provided context.  This combination of symptoms suggests a rare genetic disorder, likely a syndrome involving multiple systems.  To determine the specific symptoms, a medical professional would need to perform a thorough examination and potentially genetic testing.  The symptoms would vary depending on the specific underlying genetic condition.  However, we can discuss the individual components:\\n\\n* **Trichomegaly:** This refers to abnormally long and thick hair.  The location and extent of the hair abnormality would vary depending on the specific condition.\\n\\n* **Intellectual Disability:** This encompasses a range of cognitive impairments, impacting learning, problem-solving, and adaptive skills. The severity of intellectual disability varies greatly.\\n\\n* **Dwarfism:**  This refers to abnormally short stature.  There are many types of dwarfism, each with its own specific characteristics.  Some types are disproportionate (some body parts are shorter than others), while others are proportionate.\\n\\n* **Pigmentary Degeneration of the Retina:** This involves the progressive loss of photoreceptor cells in the retina, leading to vision impairment. Symptoms can include night blindness, tunnel vision, decreased visual acuity, and eventually, complete blindness.  The specific symptoms and rate of progression vary depending on the exact type of retinal degeneration.\\n\\nTo find information about a potential syndrome combining these symptoms, it is crucial to consult a medical geneticist or a physician who specializes in rare diseases. They will be able to conduct appropriate investigations and provide a diagnosis and treatment plan, if available.  They would likely consider genetic testing to identify the underlying cause.\\n\"\n",

Therefore, I will answer based on my general medical knowledge.\\n\\nHyperlipidemia type 3 is a rare genetic disorder characterized by significantly elevated levels of triglycerides and cholesterol in the blood, specifically affecting the levels of chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL).  Unlike other forms of hyperlipidemia,  Type 3 doesn't usually present with obvious symptoms in its early stages.  The condition is often discovered incidentally through blood tests performed for other reasons, or when complications arise.\\n\\n**Symptoms are largely indirect and manifest as complications of the high lipid levels:**\\n\\n* **Increased risk of cardiovascular disease:** This is the most significant consequence.  High cholesterol and triglycerides can lead to the buildup of plaques in arteries (atherosclerosis), increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. These events present with their own distinct symptoms, such as chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, weakness or numbness in limbs.\\n\\n* **Xanthelasma:** These are yellowish, fatty deposits that can appear under the skin around the eyelids.  While not specific to Type 3, their presence can suggest elevated cholesterol.\\n\\n* **Palmar xanthomas:** These are yellowish deposits that can appear on the palms of the hands.  Again, not specific, but suggestive of lipid abnormalities.\\n\\n* **Tendon xanthomas:** Similar yellowish deposits that can form in the tendons, particularly in the hands and feet.\\n\\n* **Tuberoeruptive xanthomas:**  These are eruptive xanthomas which are small, reddish-yellow bumps that can appear on the skin and can be itchy.\\n\\n\\nIt's crucial to understand that the absence of noticeable symptoms does *not* mean the condition is harmless.  The dangerous consequences of untreated Type 3 hyperlipidemia, namely cardiovascular events, are often the first indication that something is wrong.  Regular blood lipid testing, especially in individuals with a family history of hyperlipidemia, is essential for early detection and management.\\n\"\n",

      "Q: What are the symptoms of Oculodentodigital dysplasia ?\n",
      "True Answer: What are the signs and symptoms of Oculodentodigital dysplasia? Individuals with oculodentodigital dysplasia commonly have small eyes (microphthalmia) and other eye abnormalities that can lead to vision loss. They also frequently have tooth abnormalities, such as small or missing teeth, weak enamel, multiple cavities, and early tooth loss. Other common features of this condition include a thin nose and webbing of the skin (syndactyly) between the fourth and fifth fingers. Less common features of oculodentodigital dysplasia include sparse hair growth (hypotrichosis), brittle nails, an unusual curvature of the fingers (camptodactyly), syndactyly of the toes, small head size (microcephaly), and an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). Some affected individuals experience neurological problems such as a lack of bladder or bowel control, difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), abnormal muscle stiffness (spasticity), hearing loss, and impaired speech (dysarthria). A few people with oculodentodigital dysplasia also have a skin condition called palmoplantar keratoderma. Palmoplantar keratoderma causes the skin on the palms and the soles of the feet to become thick, scaly, and calloused. Some features of oculodentodigital dysplasia are evident at birth, while others become apparent with age. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Oculodentodigital dysplasia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition.

These wheals are similar to those seen in hives (urticaria) but are specifically triggered by physical stimuli.\\n\\nThe severity of the reaction varies widely among individuals.  Some may experience only mild itching and redness, while others have more significant welts that can be painful and widespread, potentially lasting for hours.  In more severe cases,  angioedema (swelling deeper in the skin) might also occur.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.\n"
